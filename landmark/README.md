Except for the polyline, which I couldn't figure out how to do and didn't really have time to implement given how late I started, I think I implemented this assignment correctly. I did not collaborate with anyone. I spent about 5-6 hours on this assignment, and 2-3 hours reading about the topics online. I hope it is very clear how much I relied on Ming's suggested readings and examples.
