COMP 20 Fall 2017 Private Repo for Sami Ascha

1. The purpose of this repository is to consolidate COMP20 assignments while maintaining a reliable online place for my personal exploration of the basics of web programming and security.

2. My favorite assignment was homework three. Although I did not perform well on it, I feel like I learned the most from this assignment, as it taught me the inner workings of web databases and information handling.

3. I think I've grown quite a bit, both as a programmer and as a learner. 

4. Going off of number three, I think this course taught me how to teach myself first and foremost. The internet is a vast resource and finding the right information can be a daunting task. By the end of this course, I learned to effectively research relevant programming errors and techniques. Another important thing I learned is to NEVER TRUST USER INPUT. This goes without explanation. 

5. I would like to delve deeper into serverside maintenance and security. I had a lot of fun working on assignments three and four, and would like to capitalize upon my introduction to the concepts taught in these assignments.
