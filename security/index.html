	<h1> <center> Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment </center> </h1>

	<h2> <center> Introduction </center> </h2>
	<p> The asssignment asks that each student perform a security and privacy assessment of his/her partner's client and server-side applications (assignments 2 and 3). The application returns checkins and nearest landmarks in JSON format. </p>
	<p> My partner's web application can be found <a href="https://pure-river-81762.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>


	<h2> <center> Methodology </center> </h2>
	<p> The web application suffers from several security vulnerabilities. Before looking at my partner's code, I performed a number data injections using curl per Ming's examples in class to get a feel for the app's glaring security flaws. I also looked into flooding the database using a simple bash shell script. Additionally, I used Burp Suite to perform automated security testing. </p>

	<h2> <center> Abstract of Findings </center> </h2>
	<p> <strong> XSS: </strong> XSS refers to cross-site scripting, which allows the attacker to inject malicious content into the application's database, thereby compromising the site's intended purpose. Without any parameters to defend against this, the entire web application can be ruined. </p>

	<p> <strong> No data limit: </strong> My partner's database does not set a limit (both overall and per user), which could make it susceptible to DDOS attacks. The database can be flooded arbitrarily, which is obviously something that should be avoided. </p>

	<p> <strong> X-Frame-Options Header Not Set: Without the necessary HTML headers, hackers can hijack the website's functionality and potentially steal sensitive data from the user. </strong> </p> 

	<h2> <center> Issues Found </center> </h2>

	<h3> 1. Cross-Site Scripting </h3>

	<p> Severity: <strong> High </strong> </p>

	<p> Per Ming's example in class, I was able to inject malicious scripts into the database and compromise the site's functionality using a POST request. This issue is located in /sendLocation. Here are two examples of curl injections that unwantedly alter the client's view (script tags removed). The first imposes an alert message, while the second redirects the website to youtube: </p>

	<p> <i> curl -i --data "login=script window.alert('HOW DO I TURN OFF CAPS LOCK'); /script&lat=-47&lng=-47" https://pure-river-81762.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </i> </p>


	<p> <i> curl -i --data "login=script window.location='https://www.youtube.com'; /script&lat=-47&lng=-47" https://pure-river-81762.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </i> </p>


	<p> <center> <strong> Client view: </strong> </center> </p>

	<center> <video width="500" height="300" controls>
  	<source src="curlredirect.mov" type="video/mp4"> </video> </center>

  	<p> <strong> Resolution: Sanitize data and check for invalid characters like "<" and ">" that allow for scripting. </strong> </p>




	<h3> 2. No data limit: </h3>

	<p> Severity: <strong> High </strong> </p>

	<p> As stated in the abstract, I was able curl to my partner's database an arbitrary number of times using a bash shell script. With a simple do while loop, I was able to flood my partner's database. With no limits, this makes it susceptible to DDOS attacks. Vulnerability is located in /sendLocation. Script execution and .sh file contents below. </p> 

	<p> <i> while true </i> </p>
	<p> <i> do </i> </p>
	<p> <i> curl --data "login=script window.location='https://www.youtube.com';/script&lat=0&lng=0" https://pure-river-81762.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </i> </p>
	<p> <i> done </i> </p>

	<p> <center> <strong> Executed script and corresponding database (mongodb) view: </strong> </center> </p>
	
	<center> <video width="350" height="450" controls>
  	<source src="databaseflood.mov" type="video/mp4"> </video>
  	<img src="mongodbview.png" width="400" height="450" /> </center>

  	<p> <strong> Resolution: Limit user input, for example perhaps three checkins per hour. </strong> </p>




  	<h3> 3. X-Frame-Options Header Not Set: </h3>

  	<p> Severity: <strong> High </strong> </p>

  	<p> A quick start site attack deployed via OWASP's ZAP tool exposed this error, which makes the web app susceptible to clickjacking attacks, through which the user can be tricked into revealing sensitive information. </p>

  	<p> <i> From OWASP's website: </i> "Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. Using a similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked. With a carefully crafted combination of stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes, a user can be led to believe they are typing in the password to their email or bank account, but are instead typing into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker." </p>

  	<p> Although the ZAP tool lists this as a medium risk issue, I would argue that my partner's web app is especially susceptible to these sorts of attacks due to its glaring lack of security protocols. </p>

  	<p> <strong> Resolution: </strong> Send relevant X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers so that the browser can prevent framing from other domains. Similar parameters can be specified in the source code to ensure that the given frame remains intact. Using X-Frame-Options headers like DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM, the server-side can prevent clickjacking attacks. </p>


  	<h2> Conclusion: </h2>
  	<p> The specfications for assignment three led to a number of security vulnerabilities. The issues above can be easily remedied with relevant security measures, mainly sanitization of user input. Overall, the take away from this assessment should be that <strong>USER INPUT CANNOT BE TRUSTED. </strong> </p>
